## JSON File Structure

The core components of the JSON file structure are as follows:

- Each JSON file for PyDough metadata is a JSON array where each item is a JSON object representing a single knowledge graph.
- Each knowledge graph object must have a `name` and `version` property, whose values are strings. The `name` property must be a valid Python identifier. The `version` must be set to `V2`â€”currently the only supported version.
- Specification for the remaining fields when version is set to V2:
  - `collections` (required): an array of the metadata for each collection in the graph ([see here for more details](#collections))
  - `relationships` (required): an array of the metadata for each relationship in the graph ([see here for more details](#relationships))
  - `functions` (optional): an array of the metadata for various additional function definitions defined for use within the graph ([see here for more details](#functions))
  - `additional definitions` (optional): an array of strings where each string is a sentence defining a concept/definition within the semantical context of the graph, such as the vocabulary for a specific kind of analysis and how to compute it in terms of the collections/relationships.
  - `verified pydough analysis` (optional): an array of JSON objects where each object represents an instance of a question & answer pair with PyDough using the data from the graph. The object has two fields that are both strings: `question` maps to the question being asked, and `code` is the PyDough code that solves the question using hte graph (can be multiline).
  - `extra semantic info` (optional): an object containing arbitrary additional semantic information about the entire graph (internal use only).
- Example of the structure of a metadata JSON file containing two graphs, both V2
```json
[
  {
    "name": "BankerGraph",
    "version": "V2",
    "collections": [...],
    "relationships": [...],
    "funcitons": [...],
    "additional definitions": [...]
    "verified pydough analysis": [
      {"question": ..., "code": ...},
      ...
    ],
    "extra semantic info": {...}
  },
  {
    "name": "GroceryGraph",
    "version": "V2",
    "collections": [...],
    "relationships": [...]
  }
]
```

<!-- TOC --><a name="collections"></a>
## Collections

Every JSON object describing a PyDough collection has the following fields:
- `name` (required): the name of the collection, which must be a valid PyDough identifier and cannot be the same as the name of the graph.
- `type` (required): the type of PyDough collection (currently only supports `"simple table"`).
- `description` (optional): a semantic description of the collection's significance.
- `synonyms` (optional): a list of strings of alternative names for the collection, for semantic understanding.

<!-- TOC --><a name="collection-type-simple-table"></a>
### Collection Type: Simple Table

A collection with this type is essentially just a view of a table stored in whatever database is being used to execute the queries. Collections of this type have a type string of "simple table" and the following additional key-value pairs in their metadata JSON object:

- `table path` (required): a string indicating the fully-qualified path to reach the table based on where it is stored, e.g. `<db_name>.<schema_name>.<table_name>`. The table_name here does not need to be the same as the name of the collection.
- `unique properties` (required): a list of JSON values indicating which properties are unique within the collection, meaning that no two rows of the table will have the same values. If a value in this list is a string, it means that property is unique within the collection. If a value in the list is a list of strings, it means that every combination of the properties in that list is unique within the collection.
  - Example A: `"unique properties": ["k1"]` means every value of property `k1` is unique.
  - Example B: `"unique properties": ["j1", "j2"]` means every value of property `j1` is unique, and every value of property `j2` is unique.
  - Example C: `"unique properties": [["q1", "q2"]]` means every combination of values of properties `q1` and `q2` is unique.
  - Example D: `"unique properties": ["r1", ["r2", "r3", "r4"]]` means every value of property `r1` is unique, and every combination of values of properties `r2`, `r3` and `r4` is unique.
- `properties` (required): an array of objects representing scalar properties of each record from the collection ([see here for details](#properties)).

Example of the structure of the metadata for a simple table collection:

```json
{
    "name": "accounts",
    "type": "simple table",
    "table_path": "bank_schema.ACCOUNTS",
    "unique_properties": ["account_id"],
    "properties": {
        "account_id": {...},
        "client_id": {...},
        "account_type": {...},
        "account_balance": {...},
        "date_opened": {...}
    },
    "description": "Every account currently open in the bank's system",
    "extra semantic info": {...}
}
```

<!-- TOC --><a name="properties"></a>
## Properties

Every JSON object describing a scalar property of a PyDough collection ahs the following fields:
- `name` (required): the name of the property, which must be a valid PyDough identifier and must be unique within the collection (and cannot conflict with the name of a relationship that the collection has)
- `type` (required): the type of PyDough collection property (currently only supports `"table column"`)
- `description` (optional): a semantic description of the property's significance.
- `sample values` (optional): an array of JSON objects where each value is an example of a value that can be found in the actual data for tha property.
- `synonyms` (optional): a list of strings of alternative names for the property, for semantic understanding.

<!-- TOC --><a name="property-type-table-column"></a>
### Property Type: Table Column

A property with this type is essentially just a view of a column in a table stored in whatever database is being used to execute the queries. Properties of this type are scalar expression attributes of the collection, as opposed to sub-collections. Properties of this type have a type string of "table column" and have the following additional key-value pairs in their metadata JSON object:

- `column name` (required): a string indicating the name of the column within the table it comes from, which it can be different from the name of the property itself.
- `data type` (required): a string indicating the PyDough type that this column corresponds to ([see here for details](#pydough-type-strings)).

Example of the structure of the metadata for a table column property:

```json
{
    "name": "account balance",
    "type": "table column",
    "column_name": "ba_bal",
    "data_type": "numeric",
    "description": "The amount of money currently in the account",
    "sample values": [0.0, 123.45, 999864.00],
    "synonyms": ["amount", "value", "balance"],
    "extra semantic info": {...}
}
```

<!-- TOC --><a name="relationships"></a>
## Relationships

Every JSON object describing a relationship between two PyDough collection has the following fields:
- `name` (required): the name of the relationship, which must be a valid PyDough identifier and must not overlap with the name of other properties/relationships from the source collection.
- `type` (required): the type of PyDough relationship. The currently supported values are ["simple join"](#relationship-type-simple-join), ["general join"](#relationship-type-general-join), ["cartesian product"](#relationship-type-cartesian-product), ["custom"](#relationship-type-custom) and ["reverse"](#relationship-type-reverse)
- `description` (optional): a semantic description of the relationship's significance.
- `synonyms` (optional): a list of strings of alternative names for the relationship, for semantic understanding.

<!-- TOC --><a name="relationship-type-simple-join"></a>
### Relationship Type: Simple Join

A property with this type describes a subcollection of the current collection that is derived from performing an equi-join on two tables (e.g. `SELECT ... FROM T1 JOIN T2 ON T1.a=T2.x AND T1.b = T2.y`). Relationships of this type are sub-collections of the collection, as opposed to scalar attributes. Relationships of this type have a type string of "simple join" and have the following additional key-value pairs in their metadata JSON object:

- `parent collection` (required): a string indicating the name of the parent collection that the relationship connects from. This must be the name of one of the collections in the graph.
- `child collection` (required): a string indicating the name of the child collection that the the relationship maps to. This must be the name of one of the collections in the graph.
- `singular` (required): a boolean that is true if each record in the parent collection has at most 1 matching record of the child, and false otherwise.
- `always matches` (optional): a boolean that is true if every record from the parent collection matches onto at least 1 record from the child, and false otherwise (default: `false`).
- `keys` (required): a JSON object indicating the combinations of properties from the parent collection and the child collection that are compared for equality in order to determine join matches. The keys to this JSON object are the names of properties in the current collection, and the values are a list of 1+ strings that are the names of properties in the other collection that they must be equal to in order to produce a match. All property names invoked in the keys object must correspond to scalar attributes of the collections. This object must be non-empty, and all value lists must also be non-empty.

Example of the structure of the metadata for a simple join property (connects a collection `Clients` to a collection `Accounts` by joining `Clients.id` on `Accounts.client_id`):

```json
{
    "name": "accounts_held",
    "type": "simple join",
    "parent collection": "Clients",
    "child collection": "Accounts",
    "singular": false,
    "always matches": false,
    "keys": {"id": ["client_id"]},
    "description": "All of the accounts currently held by the client in the bank's system",
    "synonyms": ["current accounts", "open accounts"]
}
```

<!-- TOC --><a name="relationship-type-general-join"></a>
### Relationship Type: General Join

This relationship type is a variant of the simple join, which instead of joining on equality of key columns has an arbitrary PyDough expression as a condition. This is useful for more arbitrary join conditions such as interval joins (e.g. `SELECT ... FROM T1 JOIN T2 ON T1.a <= T2.B AND T2.B <= T1.c`). Relationships of this type are sub-collections of the collection, as opposed to scalar attributes. Relationships of this type have a type string of "general_join" and have the following additional key-value pairs in their metadata JSON object:

- `parent collection` (required): a string indicating the name of the parent collection that the relationship connects from. This must be the name of one of the collections in the graph.
- `child collection` (required): a string indicating the name of the child collection that the the relationship maps to. This must be the name of one of the collections in the graph.
- `singular` (required): a boolean that is true if each record in the parent collection has at most 1 matching record of the child, and false otherwise.
- `always matches` (optional): a boolean that is true if every record from the parent collection matches onto at least 1 record from the child, and false otherwise (default: `false`).
- `condition` (required): a string representing the PyDough code for the condition, where columns from the current collection are referred to as `self.xyz` and columns from the child collection being accessed are referred to as `other.xyz`. This can be any valid PyDough code, with the following caveats:
  - The code must be a single Python expression.
  - The code must return a PyDough expression, as opposed to a collection.
  - The code may call regular PyDough functions, but not window functions.
  - The code may not access any sub-collections of either collection.

Example of the structure of the metadata for a simple join property (connects a collection `Incidents` to a collection `WorkerShifts` by joining on whether `Incidents.incident_timestamp` is between `WorkerShifts.start_of_shift` and `WorkerShifts.end_of_shift`):

```json
{
    "name": "shifts_overlapping_with_incident",
    "type": "general join",
    "parent collection": "Incidents",
    "child collection": "WorkerShifts",
    "singular": false,
    "always matches": false,
    "condition": "MONOTONIC(other.start_of_shift, self.incident_timestamp, other.end_of_shift)",
}
```

<!-- TOC --><a name="relationship-type-cartesian-product"></a>
### Relationship Type: Cartesian Product

A relationship with this type describes a subcollection of the current collection that is derived from performing a cross-join on two collections (e.g. SELECT ... FROM T1, T2). Relationships of this type are sub-collections of the collection, as opposed to scalar attributes. Relationships of this type have a type string of "cartesian product" and have the following additional key-value pairs in their metadata JSON object:

- `parent collection` (required): a string indicating the name of the parent collection that the relationship connects from. This must be the name of one of the collections in the graph.
- `child collection` (required): a string indicating the name of the child collection that the the relationship maps to. This must be the name of one of the collections in the graph.
- `always matches` (optional): a boolean that is true if every record from the parent collection matches onto at least 1 record from the child, and false otherwise (default: `true`). This should always be true unless it is possible for the child collection to be empty.

Example of the structure of the metadata for a cartesian product property (connects every record of a collection `CalendarDates` to every record of collection `InventorySnapshots`):

```json
{
  "name": "snapshots",
  "type": "cartesian_product",
  "parent collection": "CalendarDates",
  "child collection": "InventorySnapshots",
  "always matches": true,
  "description": "Every single snapshot, accessed from every single calendar date",
  "synonyms": ["inventory logs", "storage records", "manifests"]
}
```

### Relationship Type: Custom

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This type of metadata relationship has not yet been implemented.

<!-- TOC --><a name="relationship-type-reverse"></a>
### Relationship Type: Reverse

A relationship with this type specifies that a relationship should be created by flipping the direction of an existing relationship that was already defined earlier in the `relationships` array. Relationships of this type are sub-collections of the collection, as opposed to scalar attributes. Relationships of this type have a type string of "reverse" and have the following additional key-value pairs in their metadata JSON object:
- `original parent` (required): a string indicating the name of the collection who holds the relationship being reversed (this will be the child of the new property)
- `original property` (required): a string indicating the name of the relationship property of the parent that is being reversed.
- `singular` (optional): a boolean that is true if every record from the parent collection (the original child collection) matches onto at least 1 record from the child (the original parent), and false otherwise (default: `true`). This should always be true unless it is possible for the child collection to be empty.
- `always matches` (optional): a boolean that is true if every record from the parent collection matches onto at least 1 record from the child, and false otherwise (default: `false`).


Example of the structure of the metadata for a reverse (flips the earlier defined `Clients.accounts_held` relationship, connecting each record of `Accounts` to the client who holds it):

```json
{
  "name": "client",
  "type": "reverse",
  "original parent": "Clients",
  "original property": "accounts_held",
  "singular": true,
  "always matches": true,
  "description": "The client who holds the account",
  "synonyms": ["account holder", "owner"]
}
```

<!-- TOC --><a name="functions"></a>
## Functions

Every JSON object describing a function has the following fields:
- `name` (required): the name of the function, which must be a valid PyDough identifier and must not overlap with the name of other collections/properties/relationships/functions within the graph. This name will become reserved like other function names in PyDough (`COUNT`, `LOWER`, etc.)
- `type` (required): the type of function definition. The currently supported values are ["sql alias"](#function-type-sql-alias), ["sql window alias"](#function-type-sql-window-alias) and ["sql macro"](#function-type-sql-macro).
- `description` (optional): a semantic description of what the function does significance.
- `input signature` (optional): a JSON object describing the allowed types of inputs to the function. [See here](#function-verifiers) for the specification of these objects.
- `input signature` (optional): a JSON object describing the output type of a call to the function. [See here](#function-deducers) for the specification of these objects.

<!-- TOC --><a name="function-type-sql-alias"></a>
### Function Type: SQL Alias

A function of this type is intended to map to a function in the SQL dialect of the database being used in a 1:1 manner. E.g. if `FOO` in PyDough is an alias for `BAR` in SQL, then `FOO(x, y, z)` becomes `BAR(x, y, z)`. Functions of this type can only be scalar functions or aggregation functions, not window functions. Functions of this type have a type string of "sql alias" and have the following additional key-value pairs in their metadata JSON object:

- `sql function` (required): a string indicating the name of the function in the SQL dialect that calls to this function should correspond to.
- `aggregation` (optional): a boolean indicating whether the function is an aggregation function, as opposed to a scalar function. The default value is `false` (indicating it is a scalar function).

Example of the structure of the metadata for a SQL Alias function named `DATE_FORMAT` (a 1:1 mapping to the sqlite `STRFTIME` scalar function):

```json
{
  "name": "FORMAT_DATETIME",
  "type": "sql alias",
  "sql function": "STRFTIME",
  "description": "Formats a datetime value (second argument) into a string based on the format string (first argument). For example, `FORMAT_DATETIME('%Y-%m', d)` converts datetime value `d` into a string with the year followed by the month, separated by a dash.",
  "input signature": {...},
  "output signature": {...}
}
```

Example of the structure of the metadata for a SQL Alias function named `COMBINE_STRINGS` (a 1:1 mapping to the sqlite `GROUP_CONCAT` aggregation function):

```json
{
  "name": "COMBINE_STRINGS",
  "type": "sql alias",
  "sql function": "GROUP_CONCAT",
  "aggregation": true,
  "description": "Combines all of by strings in a column (the first argument) by concatenating them, using the second argument as a delimiter (uses ',' if not provided).",
  "input signature": {...},
  "output signature": {...}
}
```

<!-- TOC --><a name="function-type-sql-window-alias"></a>
### Function Type: SQL Window Alias

A function of this type is intended to map to a window function in the SQL dialect of the database being used in a 1:1 manner. E.g. if `FOO` in PyDough is an alias for `BAR` in SQL, then `FOO(x, ...)` becomes `BAR(x) OVER (...)`. The `OVER` clause of the window function in SQL is handled by the standard optional keyword arguments to window functions in PyDough (`by`, `per`, `cumulative`, `frame`). Functions of this type have a type string of "sql window alias" and have the following additional key-value pairs in their metadata JSON object:

- `sql function` (required): a string indicating the name of the window function in the SQL dialect that calls to this function should correspond to.
- `requires order` (optional): a boolean indicating whether the function requires a `by` clause. The default value is `false` (indicating it does not require a `by` clause).
- `requires order` (optional): a boolean indicating whether the function allows window frames, either via `cumulative=True` or by providing `frame=...`. The default value is `false` (indicating it does not allow window frames).

These optional arguments work together in the following manner:

|  | **requires order: true** | **requires order: false** |
|---|---|---|
| **allows frame: true** | The function must always be called with a `by` clause, but can optionally be called with a `cumulative`/`frame`. | The function can be called with or without a `by` clause, but if it does have a `by` clause it must have a `cumulative`/`frame`. |
| **allows frame: false** | The function must always be called with a `by` clause, but it cannot be called with a `cumulative`/`frame`. | The function cannot be called with a `by` clause, nor can it be called with a `cumulative`/`frame`. |

Example of the structure of the metadata for a SQL Window Alias function named `RELMIN` (a 1:1 mapping to the sqlite `MIN` window function):

```json
{
  "name": "RELMIN",
  "type": "sql window alias",
  "sql function": "MIN",
  "requires order": false,
  "allows frame": true,
  "description": "Obtains the smallest value in the window.",
  "input signature": {...},
  "output signature": {...}
}
```

<!-- TOC --><a name="function-type-sql-macro"></a>
### Function Type: SQL Macro

A function of this type contains a SQL text string that acts as a Python format string to inject the arguments into. E.g. if `FOO` has the macro text `"CASE WHEN {0} > {1} THEN {0} ELSE {1} END"` and it is called with arguments `x` and `y` that become `C1` and `C2` in SQL, it generates the SQL text `CASE WHEN C1 > C2 THEN C1 ELSE C2 END`. Functions of this type can only be scalar functions or aggregation functions, not window functions. Functions of this type have a type string of "sql macro" and have the following additional key-value pairs in their metadata JSON object:

- `macro text` (required): the string that is used as the Python format string to inject the SQL text for the arguments into.
- `aggregation` (optional): a boolean indicating whether the function is an aggregation function, as opposed to a scalar function. The default value is `false` (indicating it is a scalar function).

Example of the structure of the metadata for a SQL Macro function named `EPSILON` (returns whether the difference between the first two arguments is at most the third argument):

```json
{
  "name": "EPSILON",
  "type": "sql macro",
  "macro text": "ABS({0} - {1}) <= {2}",
  "description": "Returns true if the gap between the first and second argument is at most the third argument.",
  "input signature": {...},
  "output signature": {...}
}
```

Example of the structure of the metadata for a SQL Macro function named `PERCENTAGE` (an aggregation that returns the percentage of rows where the argument is True):

```json
{
  "name": "PERCENTAGE",
  "type": "sql macro",
  "aggregation": true,
  "macro text": "(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN {0} THEN 1 END)) / COUNT(*)",
  "description": "Returns the percentage of rows where the argument is True.",
  "input signature": {...},
  "output signature": {...}
}
```

<!-- TOC --><a name="function-verifiers"></a>
## Function Verifiers

The JSON for a function verifier, used in the `input signature` field of a function definition, specifies the rules for determining whether the function is called on valid vs invalid arguments. If a verifier is not provided, the default assumption is that the function can be called on any arguments.

Each verifier has a mandatory string field `type` specifying what kind of verifier it is. The currently supported values are `"fixed arguments"` and `"argument range"`.

<!-- TOC --><a name="function-verifier-type-fixed-arguments"></a>
### Function Verifier Type: Fixed Arguments

Function verifiers of this type have a type string of `"fixed arguments"` and correspond to a function that has a specific number of allowed arguments, each with one legal type. A call to the function is considered valid only if it has the same number of arguments specified by the verifier, and they are all the same types as the ones contained in the verifier. Verifiers of this type have the following additional key-value pairs in their metadata JSON object:

- `value` (required): a list of type strings ([see here for more information](#pydough-type-strings)). The length of the list is the number of arguments the function is expected to be called on, and each argument is expected to have the type of the corresponding element in the list. If the type can be anything, use `"unknown"`.

Below are several examples the JSON for such verifiers:

- Accepts no arguments: `{"type": "fixed arguments", "value": []}`
- Accepts one argument, which must be a string: `{"type": "fixed arguments", "value": ["string"]}`
- Accepts two arguments, which must both be numbers: `{"type": "fixed arguments", "value": ["numeric", "numeric"]}`
- Accepts two arguments, the first must be a datetime and the second can be anything: `{"type": "fixed arguments", "value": ["datetime", "unknown"]}`


<!-- TOC --><a name="function-verifier-type-argument-range"></a>
### Function Verifier Type: Argument Range

Function verifiers of this type have a type string of `"argument range"` and work the same as [fixed argument verifiers](#function-verifier-type-fixed-arguments) except it is possible to not include all of the arguments, as long as a minimum number of arguments is provided. Verifiers of this type have the following additional key-value pairs in their metadata JSON object:

- `value` (required): a list of type strings ([see here for more information](#pydough-type-strings)). The length of the list is the maximum number of arguments the function is expected to be called on, and each argument that is provided is expected to have the type of the corresponding element in the list. If the type can be anything, use `"unknown"`.
- `min` (required): an integer indicating the smallest number of arguments that must be provided.

Below are several examples the JSON for such verifiers:

- Accepts up to two arguments of any type: `{"type": "argument range", "value": ["unknown", "unknown"], "min": 0}`
- Accepts up to two arguments, the first a string and the second a number, but the first must always be provided: `{"type": "argument range", "value": ["string", "numeric"], "min": 1}`

<!-- TOC --><a name="function-deducers"></a>
## Function Deducers

The JSON for a function deducer, used in the `output signature` field of a function definition, specifies the rules for determining the output type of a call to the function in terms of its input arguments. If a verifier is not provided, the default assumption is that the function call outputs an expression of type `"unknown"`.

Each deducer has a mandatory string field `type` specifying what kind of verifier it is. The currently supported values are `"constant"` and `"select argument"`.

<!-- TOC --><a name="function-deducer-type-constant"></a>
### Function Deducer Type: Constant

Function deducers of this type have a type string of `"constant"` and correspond to a function call that always returns the same type. Verifiers of this type have the following additional key-value pairs in their metadata JSON object:

- `value` (required): a type string ([see here for more information](#pydough-type-strings)) indicating what type the function always returns.

Below are several examples the JSON for such deducers:

- Always returns a string: `{"type": "constant", "value": "string"}`
- Always returns a datetime: `{"type": "constant", "value": "datetime"}`
- The return type is unknown: `{"type": "constant", "value": "unknown"}`

<!-- TOC --><a name="function-deducer-type-select-argument"></a>
### Function Deducer Type: Select Argument

Function deducers of this type have a type string of `"constant"` and correspond to a function call that always returns the same type. Verifiers of this type have the following additional key-value pairs in their metadata JSON object:

- `value` (required): a type string ([see here for more information](#pydough-type-strings)) indicating what type the function always returns.

Below are several examples the JSON for such deducers:

- Returns the type of the first argument: `{"type": "select argument", "value": 0}`
- Returns the type of the second argument: `{"type": "select argument", "value": 1}`

<!-- TOC --><a name="pydough-type-strings"></a>
## PyDough Type Strings

The strings used in the type field for certain properties must be one of the following:

- `numeric`: any numerical data such as integers, floats, decimals, regardless of scale/precision.
- `bool`: a boolean.
- `string`: a string or other bytes-like format (char, varchar, binary, varbinary, etc.).
- `datetime`: any date/timestamp type, regardless of precision or timezone.
- `array[t]`: an array of values of type t (where t is another PyDough type). For example: `array[numeric]` or `array[array[string]]`.
- `map[t1,t2]`: a map of values with keys of type type t1 and values of type t2 (where t1 and t2 are also PyDough types). For example: `map[string,numeric]` or `map[string,array[datetime]]`.
- `struct[field1:t1,field2:t2,...]`: a struct of values with fields named field1, field2, etc. with types t1, t2, etc. (which are also PyDough types). For example: `struct[x:numeric,y:numeric]` or `struct[name:string,birthday:datetime,car_accidents:array[struct[ts:datetime,report:string]]`. Each field name must be a valid Python identifier.
- `unknown`: an unknown/other type.

### Example: TPC-H

This example of a PYDough metadata JSON contains a single knowledge graph for the TPC-H database ([see here for spec details](https://www.tpc.org/TPC_Documents_Current_Versions/pdf/TPC-H_v3.0.1.pdf)).

It also includes several function definitions that make sense in the context of a SQLite Database:
- `DATE_FORMAT(x, y)` is an alias for `STRFTIME(x, y)`
- `COMBINE_STRINGS(x, y)` is an alias for `GROUP_CONCAT(x, y)`
- `RELMIN(x, ...)` is an alias for `MIN(x) OVER (...)`
- `POSITIVE(x)` is a macro for `x > 0`
- `PERCENTAGE(x)` is a macro for `(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN x THEN 1 END)) / COUNT(*)`
