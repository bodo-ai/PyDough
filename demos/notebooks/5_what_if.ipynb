    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through how PyDough can be leveraged to perform \"WHAT-IF\" analysis. At its core, we are typically looking for insights on questions that are much too complex or abstract, such as \"How can we improve sales in Q2?\" As a result, this approach incentivizes faster iteration to rapidly explore various scenarios in the hope of uncovering insights that can resolve our abstract problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that PyDough is ideal for these types of questions because PyDough can be used to solve common intermediate problems and quickly iterate betwen alterantive versions. Rather than focusing on a single query to answer a question at hand, building components allows more proportional scaling and more easily modifying the scenario. The PyDough team is optimistic that such an approach can make humans more productive and LLMs more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will focus on addressing a single question, but we will illustrate the principles that make such a question convenient for rapid iteration. Towards the end of this notebook, we will then modify this base question in the spirit of \"WHAT-IF\", but this will not be a complete what if analysis. We encourage you to explore new ways to extend this investigation by consulting the [PyDough documentation](../../documentation/usage.md)."
