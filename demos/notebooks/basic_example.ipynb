    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a basic example of the process of working in PyDough to answer an analytics question. It highlights how PyDough can be leveraged to guide the development and experimentation process, with an emphasis on solving partial sub-problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that is this approach is more composable and scalable. Rather than focusing on building a query to answer a question at hand, building question components allows more proportional scaling relative to the complexity at hand. The PyDough team is optimistic that such an approach can make human more productive effective and LLMs more accurate at solving the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of this notebook will be focused on building up a more complex question piece by piece. At some places we will also deviate from this question to emphasize the powerful PyDough features that enable this type of experimentation."

    "We will build an answer to this question in PyDough and use this to explain how PyDough can allow easy iteration in the analytics process. For a point of comparison, here is a possible SQL query that could we be used to answer this question.\n",

    "with total_order_revenue as (\n",
    "    select\n",
    "        o_orderkey as order_key,\n",
    "        SUM(L_EXTENDED_PRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) as order_total\n",
    "    from orders\n",
    "    inner join lines\n",
    "    group by o_orderkey\n",
    ")\n",
    "Select\n",

    "\n",
    "The sample answer uses a CTE statement produce a result per order that can then be re-combined with the original lines. However, there are also some subtle issue that could arise. Namely:\n",
    "* Should the joins between lines and orders be inner joins or left joins?\n",
    "* If the joins were left joins, what should we do if a line wasn't associated with an order (and vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular example **because we know the exact constraints of the TPC-H setup** we can verify that the provided query is correct and we don't need to worry about left joins. However, in a production setting, such differences can result in subtle bugs that due to SQL's holistic nature can be very difficult to debug, even though this is a relatively simple query. It also means that if the constraints differ or change between the pulling information from two different data sources, the SQL query developed could ultimately lead to incorrect results."
